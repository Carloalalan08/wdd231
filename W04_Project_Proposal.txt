Project Proposal Submission (Week 4)

Subject of the Website:
Bigger Whale - A Printing Press Business

Planned Content:
The website will consist of the following pages:

    Home: An introduction to Bigger Whale, its mission, and key services.

    Services: A detailed breakdown of printing services offered, including business cards, flyers, tarpaulins, brochures, and more.

    Portfolio: A showcase of past projects to highlight quality, creativity, and design capabilities.

    Contact Us: A form for customers to inquire about services, request quotes, or visit the shop.

Additional Features:

    Customer testimonials to enhance credibility and trust.

    A price estimate tool or an interactive quote calculator.

    A blog or news section to share updates, promotions, and industry insights.

Reason for Choosing This Subject:
Bigger Whale currently lacks an online presence, which limits its marketing reach. Developing a website will help attract more customers, provide an easy way to inquire about services, and effectively showcase the businessâ€™s work to potential clients. Since I work there, I have direct access to accurate content and branding materials, ensuring the site aligns with the company's vision.
